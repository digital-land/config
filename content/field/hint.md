guidance: ' Do not use long paragraphs and lists in hint text. Screen readers read
  out the entire text when users interact with the form element. This could frustrate
  users if the text is long.

  Do not include links within hint text. While screen readers will read out the link
  text when describing the field, they will not tell users that the text is a link.'
